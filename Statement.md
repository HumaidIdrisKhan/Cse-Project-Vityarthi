## **Problem Statement**

The increasing use of digital shopping platforms has created the need for simple, reliable systems that can simulate the core operations of online retail. Many academic and beginner-level projects require a functional shopping system without involving databases or graphical interfaces. This project addresses the need for a Python-based console application that allows users to browse products, manage a shopping cart, apply coupons, estimate delivery dates, and generate receipts. It solves the challenge of organizing a complete shopping workflow using only basic Python structures such as dictionaries, lists, and counters.

## **Scope of the Project**

The scope of this project includes the development of a full shopping cart system that operates entirely through the console. It covers product management using a 30-item inventory with prices and stock, cart addition and removal with quantity control, billing with item frequency tables, coupon application, delivery estimation, receipt generation, and user interaction through a login and menu-based flow. The project does not involve external databases, payment gateways, GUI interfaces, or APIs. Its scope is strictly educational and focuses on demonstrating logical structures and problem-solving using Python.

## **Target Users**

This project is mainly designed for students, beginners in Python, and individuals who wish to understand how an e-commerce backend workflow can be developed without complex libraries. It is also suitable for academic submissions where a simple console-based system is sufficient. Developers who want to practice data handling, menu-driven interfaces, user input processing, and file generation can also benefit from this project.

## **High Level Features**

The system offers a complete shopping experience within the terminal. It provides a login interface, displays a 30-item inventory with price and stock, supports adding and removing multiple items with automatic stock updates, and generates a frequency-based summary of the cart during checkout. The user can apply a coupon code for discounts, receive an estimated delivery date generated randomly between three and seven days, and obtain a structured receipt saved as a text file. The entire flow is interactive, cleanly structured, and reflects the essential logic behind real-world retail systems in a simplified manner.
